#version 330

// This fragment shader will add Gaussian noise to a rendered image.  It's
// intended to be instantiated via Ogre's Compositor framework so that we're
// operating on a previously rendered image.  We're doing it a shader for
// efficiency: a naive CPU implementation slows camera rates from 30Hz to 10Hz,
// while this GPU implementation has no noticable effect on performance.
//
// We're applying additive amplifier noise, as described at:
// http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_noise#Amplifier_noise_.28Gaussian_noise.29
// This is uncorrelated Gaussian noise added to each pixel.  For each pixel, we
// want to sample a new value from a Gaussian distribution and add it to each
// channel in the input image.
//
// There isn't (as far as I can tell) a way to generate random values in GLSL.
// The GPU vendors apparently don't implement the noise[1-4]() functions that
// are described in the documentation.  What we do have is a deterministic
// function that does a decent job of appoximating a uniform distribution
// on [0,1].  But it requires a 2-D vector as input.
//
// So we're doing something mildly complicated:
//
// 1. On the CPU, before each call to this shader, generate 3 random numbers
// that are uniformly distributed on [0,1.0] and pass them here,
// in the `offsets` parameter.
//
// 2. Each time we need a random number here, add one of the CPU-provided
// offsets to our current pixel coordinates and give the resulting vector to our
// pseudo-random number generator.
//
// 3. Implement the Box-Muller method to sample from a Gaussian distribution.
// Normally each iteration of this method requires 2 uniform inputs and
// gives 2 Gaussian outputs.  We're using 3 uniform inputs, with the 3rd
// being used to select randomly between the 2 Gaussian outputs.
//
// 4. Having produced a Gaussian sample, we add this value to each channel of
// the input image.
