    /// definiton from script. The base scene pass node is responsible for
    /// rendering the initial scene and passes its output to any RenderPass'es
    /// that are added to the RenderTarget. Each RenderPass has its own ogre
    /// compositor node that receives the output from the previous RenderPass
    /// as input, applies its own pass over the input, and sends the result to
    /// the next RenderPass. Note that the Ogre2RenderPass class provides the
    /// node definition only and the actual node creation work is done in the
    /// Ogre2RenderTarget class when the whole workspace is constructed.
