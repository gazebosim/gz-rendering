\page depth_camera Depth camera

This example shows how to use the depth camera.

## Install prerequisites

In order to compile this tutorial, you need to install some prerequisites :

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential freeglut3-dev libglew-dev
```

## Compile and run the example

Clone the source code, create a build directory and use `cmake` and `make` to compile the code:

```{.sh}
git clone https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-rendering
cd gz-rendering/examples/depth_camera
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Execute the example:

```{.sh}
./depth_camera ogre
```

You'll see:

```{.sh}

## Code

Most of the code is adapted from \ref simple_demo, here we outline the key differences.

The function `buildScene()` is responsible for creating and configuring the depth camera.
The main points to note are:

- The image format is set to `PixelFormat::PF_FLOAT32_RGBA`,
- Anti-alising is enabled,
- The depth texture is created after configuration is modified from defaults.

The window updating code is in `GlutWindow.cc`. The function `initCamera()`
registers a callback with the camera that captures a copy of
the depth image each frame. This will later be drawn to the window in
the main update loop.

The depth camera is capable of generating both color and depth data.
This example shows how to connect and receive depth data in the
`OnNewDepthFrame()` callback function.

It converts the depth image to a RGB grayscale format and copies it from the
depth camera to a memory reserved in a globally scoped `Image`.

The other option is the [ConnectNewRgbPointCloud](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-rendering/blob/main/include/gz/rendering/DepthCamera.hh#L58) call that receives colored point cloud data on callback.

The reason for setting the camera image format to `PixelFormat::PF_FLOAT32_RGBA`
is to ensure that when the `Image` is created it reserves a buffer of the
correct size so that it is able to pack both color and depth data.
