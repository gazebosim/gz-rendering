Gazebo Rendering is a C++ library designed to provide an abstraction
for different rendering engines. It offers unified APIs for creating
3D graphics applications.

Gazebo Rendering is a component in the ignition framework, a set
of libraries designed to rapidly develop robot applications.

# Features

* Support for rendering engines including OGRE and OptiX (experimental)
* Plugin-based architecture. Mulitple rendering engine plugins can be loaded at run time.
* Object-oriented scene management.

# Install

See the [installation tutorial](https://gazebosim.org/api/rendering/5.0/installation.html).

# Usage

The Ign Rendering API can be found in the documentation. See the
[installation tutorial](https://gazebosim.org/api/rendering/5.0/installation.html)
on how to build the documentation files using Doxygen.

You can also take a look at the sample applications in the `examples` folder.

# Folder Structure

* `include/ignition/rendering`: Contains all the public header files which will be installed

* `src`: Contains all the C++ source code which are not installed.

* `test`: All integration, performance and regression tests go here, under their
  specific folders.

* `examples`: Sample programs to demonstrate different features of ign-rendering

* `doc`: Files used by Doxygen when generating documentation.

Rendering engine plugin implementation code is stored in their own folders

* `ogre` : OGRE 1.x rendering engine plugin

* `ogre2` : OGRE 2.x rendering engine plugin (available in versions >= ign-rendering1)

* `optix` : OptiX rendering engine plugin
